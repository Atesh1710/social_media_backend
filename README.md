# social_media_backend
This project is a Node.js-based backend for a social media platform with features like user authentication (JWT-based), post creation, following/unfollowing, and interacting with posts. It uses PostgreSQL as the database and follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.
#Features
User Registration and Authentication (JWT)
Create, Read, and Delete Posts
Follow/Unfollow Users
Comment and Like posts
Secure API endpoints

#Prerequisites
Ensure you have Node.js installed (v14+ recommended) and PostgreSQL running.

#Installation
1. Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/social-media-backend.git
  cd social-media-backend

2. Navigate to the api folder:
   cd api
   
3. Install all dependencies:
   npm i / npm install

#Dependencies include:

pg for PostgreSQL interaction
crypto for password hashing
jsonwebtoken (JWT) for user authentication
moment for time formatting
bcryptjs for password encryption
express for handling routes
sequelize for ORM (Object Relational Mapping)

4. Set up environment variables in a .env file (create it in the root of the api folder):
DB_HOST=your-db-host
DB_USER=your-db-username
DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password
DB_DATABASE=your-db-name
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key

5. Set up the database: Run PostgreSQL and make sure to create the required database for the application. You can then sync the Sequelize models by running the project.

#Commands to Start the Project
